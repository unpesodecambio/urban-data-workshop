# 🏙️ Urban Data Workshop

Welcome to my **Urban Data Workshop**, a personal learning space where I explore **geospatial data analysis**, **urban visualization**, and **data-driven storytelling** through hands-on projects.

This repository compiles short analyses, code experiments, and mini-projects developed to improve my technical skills and build a professional portfolio in **urban data science**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen data analysis and visualization skills using Python and GIS.  
- Apply geospatial tools to real-world urban and mobility datasets.  
- Build reproducible workflows and share results publicly.  
- Combine technical accuracy with visual clarity in data storytelling.

## 🧰 Tools and libraries

- **Python 3 / Jupyter Notebooks**  
- `pandas`, `numpy` — data processing  
- `geopandas`, `contextily`, `folium` — spatial analysis and mapping  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` — visualization  
- `scikit-learn` — clustering and statistical analysis
